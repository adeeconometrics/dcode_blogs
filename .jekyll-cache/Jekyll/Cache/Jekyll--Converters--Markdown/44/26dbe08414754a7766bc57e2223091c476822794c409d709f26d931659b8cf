I"µ<p>There are two general ways of looking at data structures: concept and implementation. Ideally, they should serve you the sense in selecting an effective data structure for a given problem. Fundamental data structures manifest themselves naturally in most situations. The problem usually demands a certain data structure, while others could be represented in different ways. An effective data structure should simplify the problem. But that is only half of the story since a data structure must also ensure computational efficiency. We can simplify the problem by conceptually looking for an apt data structure while performance benefits are obtained by looking into the implementation.</p>
